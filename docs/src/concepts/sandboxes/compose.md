# Compose sandboxes

`POST /sandboxes-compose` runs an image-only Docker Compose project inside one
Firecracker sandbox. The node resolves each source image through `ImageResolver`.
Each service gets its own writable attached drive, including services using the
same image. Inside the VM, `containerd-plain-snapshotter` registers those mounted
root filesystems with Docker while preserving image configuration (entrypoint,
command, environment, user, working directory, healthcheck, and volumes).

## Enable the runtime

The initial runtime supports Linux x86-64/KVM. Build from the repository root and
publish to a registry accessible to the node. The image build rejects other
target architectures. Docker and Compose downloads are verified against pinned
SHA-256 digests; overriding their version build arguments also requires updating
the corresponding `DOCKER_SHA256` or `COMPOSE_SHA256` argument:

```sh
docker build -f compose-image/Dockerfile -t REGISTRY/agentenv-compose:1 .
docker push REGISTRY/agentenv-compose:1
cd services
go build -o aenv-compose-plan ./compose/cmd
```

Install `aenv-compose-plan` on the node's PATH, or configure an absolute path:

```toml
[compose]
base_image = "REGISTRY/agentenv-compose:1"
planner_binary = "/usr/local/bin/aenv-compose-plan"
```

Environment overrides are `AENV_COMPOSE_BASE_IMAGE` and
`AENV_COMPOSE_PLANNER_BINARY`. Sandbox creation is disabled when no base image is
set; build planning only requires the planner.
The server Docker image and release bundle include the planner. Extracting a
bundle alone does not add it to PATH; install it or set the absolute path above.

The dedicated image includes Docker 28.4.0, Compose 2.39.4, their containerd/runc,
and the plain snapshotter. The Linux `aenv` binary also provides the hidden
`compose guest-init` and `compose guest-start` commands used by the guest.
The guest does not require Python.
`/init` supervises the runtime with tini. It uses an
explicit containerd socket and fails if Docker does not select `plain`. The
existing tools drive and envd are unchanged. The guest kernel must support
containers: cgroup v2, namespaces, veth, bridge, conntrack, iptables, and NAT.
Docker 28 also requires `CONFIG_IP_NF_RAW=y` (and `CONFIG_IP6_NF_RAW=y` for IPv6).
The current bundled 6.1.175 kernel lacks these options. Build a compatible kernel
with the optional Docker target (compilation runs as a non-root user), then set
its path on the Compose node:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f compose-image/Dockerfile \
  --target kernel-output --output type=local,dest=compose-kernel .
```

```toml
[kernel]
image_path = "/absolute/path/compose-kernel/vmlinux-compose-6.1.175"
```

The kernel target pins the Firecracker guest configuration and Linux version, enabling
PCI support required for ACPI initialization in vanilla Linux, plus the two
raw-table options. It does not replace the host kernel or update other nodes.
The source archive is verified against a pinned SHA-256 digest. Parallel kernel
build jobs default to the available CPU count, capped at roughly one job per
GiB of available memory; pass `--build-arg JOBS=4` to override this heuristic.
Keep the resulting kernel consistent across nodes restoring the same
sandbox snapshots. Do not disable Docker's raw-table protections as a workaround.

## Build service images

If services specify `build`, first use the CLI's Compose build mode:

```sh
aenv build --compose compose.yaml --output compose.built.yaml
aenv compose up -f compose.built.yaml
```

`aenv build --compose` builds the active services' Dockerfiles with the remote
BuildKit builder, and the server imports each finished image into the node's
local image cache. No registry is involved. It does not start the service
containers or create runnable VM templates. Services that already specify only
`image` are retained. The runtime API continues to accept image-only
projects; it does not receive local build contexts.

The CLI requests a build plan from `POST /sandboxes-compose/plan` on the server.
This authenticated endpoint accepts `compose`, `composeEnv`, `profiles`, and
`harbor`, and returns normalized Compose plus per-service build instructions.
It has a 30-second planning budget, reads no local files, and allocates no builders
or sandboxes. Only the server needs `aenv-compose-plan`; upgrade it together with
the CLI. Build contexts are subsequently uploaded from the client to BuildKit.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--compose <path>` | Local Compose YAML or JSON file. |
| `--image-repository <registry/repository>` | Optional: additionally push images to this registry and reference the pushed tags instead of the node-local import. See "Registry distribution" below. |
| `--output <path>` | Output file; defaults to `compose.built.yaml` beside the input. Must not already exist. |
| `--env KEY=VALUE` | Explicit interpolation/build argument environment; repeatable, last value wins. Process environment and `.env` files are not loaded. |
| `--profile <name>` | Select optional services; repeatable. Selected profiles are resolved into the output. |
| `--harbor` | Apply Harbor's main-service build and keepalive defaults before normalizing a task's Compose override file. Explicit task settings take precedence. |
| `--registry-insecure` | Permit HTTP or untrusted TLS for pushes to a development registry. Runtime registry access must be configured separately. |

Shared build flags `--no-cache`, `--buildctl`, `--progress`, and `--timeout` also
apply (`--timeout` is per service). Put per-service build arguments in the Compose
file. Supported build fields are `context`, `dockerfile`, `args`, `target`, and
`no_cache`, including the `build: ./directory` shorthand. Contexts must be local
directories; relative contexts resolve beside the Compose file and Dockerfiles
resolve relative to their build context. Images target `linux/amd64`.

The built file references each built image by manifest digest (`sha256:...`).
The gateway resolves the selected Compose services, including explicit environment
interpolation and profiles, and the scheduler chooses available capacity with all
required images. No node identifiers or placement headers are required from clients.
During a multi-service build, the CLI supplies previously built digests as
`imageDependencies`; the server places subsequent builders where those images are
available. Registry builds do not require local-image dependencies.

Imported images are node cache entries: capacity eviction may reclaim them. Node
heartbeats replace the scheduler's cache inventory, including after restarts. If
no eligible capacity has every required image, creation fails with guidance to
retry, rebuild, or use registry images. A successful image-only build publishes its
cache inventory before reporting ready when scheduler reporting is enabled.
With `image.cache.gc` disabled, imports are never evicted and accumulate.

The input file is unchanged. The output is JSON, which Compose accepts as YAML,
and contains no `build` or `pull_policy: build` entries. It is written only after
every service succeeds; partial failures may leave imported images for the cache
to reclaim. Unsupported Compose features and missing build files are rejected
before allocating builders. The server must support image-only builder sessions.

Status, logs, and cleanup use the existing `buildID`. Image results remain in the
node's durable build journal until explicit builder deletion, independently of
worker cleanup. Their routing bindings are refreshed by heartbeats and recovered
on restart without retaining a worker or consuming a build slot. Deleting a
builder's result does not delete its cached image. These image results are not
snapshots. Upgrade the gateway, scheduler, server, and CLI together.

### Registry distribution

To run the sandbox on a different node than the build without pinning, to share
images across clusters, or to rely on registry retention, pass
`--image-repository REGISTRY/REPOSITORY`. Each build then additionally pushes a
unique tag, and the built file references those tags instead of local digests.
The repository must be reachable from both the builder VM and the runtime node.
BuildKit uses the CLI user's Docker registry credentials for push. Runtime nodes
need their own pull credentials. For private registry addresses, the node's
`network.egress.always_denied_cidrs` must permit builder access.
`--registry-insecure` changes TLS handling only; it does not bypass the node's
network policy. The CLI installer bundles `aenv-buildctl`; a local Docker daemon
is not required.

For Terminal-Bench 4.0 tasks, use the original environment directory:

```sh
aenv build --compose tasks/freight-dispatch-shift/environment/docker-compose.yaml \
  --harbor --output freight.built.yaml
aenv compose up -f freight.built.yaml --cpu 4 --memory 8192
```

`--harbor` supplies `main.build.context: .` when neither image nor build is set,
and `main.command: [sh, -c, sleep infinity]` when command is omitted, matching
Harbor's build base configuration. It prepares the task environment; it does not
run Harbor agents, inject verifier files, or grade benchmark solutions.

## Create a sandbox

`aenv compose up` creates one sandbox running an image-only Compose project. The
command waits for the services to become running or healthy, prints only the
sandbox ID to stdout, and exits without attaching a shell. Each invocation
creates a new sandbox.

```sh
cat > compose.yaml <<'YAML'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:1.27-alpine
    ports: ["8080:80"]
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 1s
      retries: 30
    volumes: ["data:/data"]
volumes:
  data: {}
YAML
aenv compose up -f compose.yaml --cpu 2 --memory 2048 --timeout 600
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-f, --file <PATH>` | Compose YAML or JSON file (default: `compose.yaml`); `-` reads stdin. Maximum 1 MiB. |
| `--env <KEY=VALUE>` | Explicit interpolation variable; repeatable, with the last value winning. Empty values are allowed. |
| `--profile <NAME>` | Enable an optional Compose profile; repeatable. |
| `--timeout <secs>` | Sandbox TTL after readiness (default: 300). |
| `--startup-timeout <secs>` | Total startup budget, including image resolution and health checks (1–300; default: 300). |
| `--cpu <count>` | CPU cores. Alias: `--cpu-count`. |
| `--memory <MiB>` | Memory in MiB. Aliases: `--memory-mb`, `--mem`. |
| `--disk-size-mb <MiB>` | Root filesystem size, at least 1024 and divisible by 1024 MiB. Alias: `--disk-mb`. |

After `aenv auth`, the CLI reads the file, waits for Compose readiness, and prints
the sandbox ID. Only `--env` values are used for interpolation; local environment
variables and `.env` files are not loaded. Resource defaults come from the server.
The HTTP request allows an additional 60 seconds beyond the startup budget for
cleanup. Startup failures produce a non-zero exit status and the API error on
stderr. Manage the returned sandbox with `aenv exec`, `connect`, `pause`,
`resume`, `snapshot`, and `delete`. The same endpoint remains available directly:

```sh
jq -n --rawfile compose compose.yaml \
  '{compose:$compose,cpuCount:2,memoryMB:2048,timeout:600,startupTimeout:300}' \
  | curl --max-time 330 -fsS "$AENV_API_URL/sandboxes-compose" \
      -H "X-API-Key: $AENV_API_KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @-
```

The response is the usual sandbox object and `x-agentenv-sandbox-id` header.
Access published TCP ports through the existing sandbox proxy; they are published
inside the VM. Port 49983 is reserved for envd. Services can reach one another by
Compose service name on their bridge network.

`composeEnv` supplies interpolation variables; `profiles` selects optional
services. The node does not read its process environment, `.env`, or local files.
Interpolation runs once: literal `$$` and dollars introduced by `composeEnv`
survive the guest's second Compose load. Image pulls happen on the node using
its configured registry credentials; the guest uses local aliases and
`--pull never --no-build`.

`startupTimeout` is 1–300 seconds (default 300), covering planning, image
resolution, VM boot, registration, and Compose readiness. Cleanup may extend
the response time. In-flight host resource acquisitions finish before rollback
so their devices and processes can be reclaimed; no further startup stage begins
after the deadline is observed. The gateway reserves at least 330 seconds for this route.
`timeout` is the sandbox TTL after readiness (default 300); `autoPause` defaults
to true. Compose creation enables secure envd access; use the returned token
when executing commands through envd.

The API publishes `Running` only after `docker compose up --wait` succeeds.
Services without healthchecks must be running; services with healthchecks must
be healthy. Dependencies use Compose's normal `depends_on` semantics. A failure
or deadline expiry destroys the partial sandbox through the existing lifecycle
cleanup. Guest runtime logs are under `/var/log/agentenv-compose`; normalized
Compose and source image configurations are under `/var/lib/agentenv-compose`.

## Supported scope

- One container per service, 1–24 selected services, maximum 1 MiB Compose source.
- Maximum 2 MiB HTTP request and 4 MiB complete guest startup plan, including
  resolved image metadata. YAML expansion and variable interpolation have bounded
  budgets; YAML nesting is limited to 128 levels. Oversized plans are rejected
  before VM allocation.
- Image references, commands, entrypoints, environment, healthchecks, dependencies,
  profiles, local named volumes, tmpfs, bridge networks, fixed published TCP ports.
  Conflicting published ports across selected services are rejected before startup.
- `network_mode: service:<name>` shares another selected service's network
  namespace. `cap_add` permits `SYS_PTRACE` inside the sandbox for debugging tasks.
- Existing sandbox pause/resume, capture, fork, and deletion. VM memory and disk
  snapshots preserve the running Docker/containerd/snapshotter processes; restore
  does not register images again or repeat Compose initialization.

Inline builds at the runtime API, replicas/scaling, host bind mounts, external files (`env_file`, `include`,
`extends`, `label_file`), secrets/configs, external networks/volumes, custom volume
drivers, host networking/devices, privileged mode, and UDP publishing are rejected.
Named volumes live in the sandbox root disk; they are not AgentENV managed volumes.

The plain snapshotter keeps active snapshot metadata in memory. Restarting
Docker/containerd/the snapshotter independently is unsupported. Recreating a
container reuses its service's writable rootfs rather than discarding its writes.
To reset the application, create a new sandbox. This initial integration depends
on the snapshotter introduced in upstream PR #318.

## Validate an installation

On an isolated test node with `aenv` installed, run:

```sh
cargo test -p aenv --bin aenv commands::compose
cargo test -p aenv --test compose_runtime
AENV_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001 AENV_API_KEY=... \
  python3 compose-image/test_e2e.py
```

The test checks same-image service isolation, health dependencies, DNS, published
ports, interpolation, pause/resume, fork, snapshot restore, and failure cleanup.
It deletes its sandboxes and snapshots and uses temporary CLI credentials.

To test original Terminal-Bench 4.0 Compose environments on an isolated node:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --branch v4.0.0 https://github.com/harbor-framework/terminal-bench.git
AENV_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001 AENV_API_KEY=... \
  python3 compose-image/test_e2e.py terminal-bench --tasks terminal-bench/tasks \
  --results tb4-results
```

The script tests all tasks containing `environment/docker-compose.yaml`, or
repeat `--task NAME` to select tasks. It uses `aenv build --harbor` followed by
`aenv compose up`, checks service health and execution in `main`, records timings
and source hashes, and deletes each sandbox. Built-file reports are retained.
This validates environment startup, not benchmark solution scores.
